# Notes

Proper documentation coming soon. But for now, here are a few tips to get it going:

1. Download and install the module (./modules/custom/drupalstat)
2. Create a new page (e.g. /system-status), and add the DrupalStat block to it. It is a full-width block, so put it in the main content area, etc. If you are also using our Redistat module, they can both be on the same page, as they are blocks. :)
3. Be sure to restrict access to the new page to admins only or what not.
